Have the client verify the legality of a move before sending it to the server
Add indication of who plays (human or AI) and difficulty level if AI

add a "single move still possible" error when provided with double moves in both server and client

out logs server

extra thread for AI question?

The client should be able to withstand:
 - randomly dropping connections
 - malformed networking messages
 - Illegal moves

Go through all classes and improve them / fix TODOs

check in client if a player is not moving to give the correct response

figure out if toString() in enum Direction is important

perhaps simplify the checks in server (and perhaps client) for example when checking if the game is null

write a BUNCH of tests (both unit and integration tests)

write TONS of javadoc

change the client to display the new move made better, as well as the index for the hint

perhaps display score and balls clientside


timeout for ai prompt

BOARD command to print board


write some in line comments
--> (important: should not be about 'what' is happening, rather 'why' it is happening)




command for the client when s/he is in queue to choose whether s/he wants to play with AI when there are no other players in q
