Missing functionality from serverside:
 - Check for login name length
 - Queue doesn't work [POSSIBLY FIXED: CHECK WITH TWO PLAYERS]
 - Game is not implemented (correctly)

Add log tracking which is not shown to the user (using TUI.printLog, also handles ERROR)
Add log command to controller to allow user to view logs
    - add showAllLogs to TUI, add showLastLog (for server) ?
Add connect functionality to client
Add reconnect functionality to client

When server disconnects before you sent a name to log in with, and then you do send a name, there is an error (catch this error)

? move Misc class to other classes (TUI, seperate Move class, etc.)

Go through all classes and improve them / fix TODOs
