Add startup functionality to client
Add startup functionality to server

When server disconnects before you sent a name to log in with, and then you do send a name, there is an error (catch this error)

Go through all classes and improve them / fix TODOs

Have the client verify the legality of a move before sending it to the server
Add indication of who plays (human or AI) and difficulty level if AI
Ask server for a different port if one is already taken
Ask a client user for an IP and a port
Add help command
Add hint command
Terminate client cleanly when connection to the server is dropped

add a "single move still possible" error when provided with double moves

? Change the way prompts work to only use the same prompt

The client should be able to withstand:
 - randomly dropping connections
 - malformed networking messages
 - Illegal moves
