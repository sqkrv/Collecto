Have the client verify the legality of a move before sending it to the server
Add indication of who plays (human or AI) and difficulty level if AI

add a "single move still possible" error when provided with double moves

change the logs on client and server to be prettier

The client should be able to withstand:
 - randomly dropping connections
 - malformed networking messages
 - Illegal moves

Go through all classes and improve them / fix TODOs





write a BUNCH of tests (both unit and itegration tests)

write TONS of javadoc

write some in line comments
--> (important: should not be about 'what' is happening, rather 'why' it is happening)
