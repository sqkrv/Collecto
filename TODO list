Missing functionality from serverside:
 - Check for login name length
 - List doesn't work
 - Queue doesn't work
 - Game is not implemented (correctly)

Add log tracking which is not shown to the user
Add log command to controller to allow user to view logs
    - add showAllLogs to TUI, add showLastLog (for server) ?
Add connect functionality to client
Add reconnect functionality to client

? move Misc class to other classes (TUI, seperate Move class, etc.)

Go through all classes and improve them / fix TODOs
