out logs server

change error logs (client)

The client should be able to withstand:
 - randomly dropping connections
 - malformed networking messages
 - Illegal moves

Go through all classes and improve them / fix TODOs
perhaps simplify the checks in server (and perhaps client) for example when checking if the game is null
figure out if toString() in enum Direction is important

write a BUNCH of tests (both unit and integration tests)
write TONS of javadoc
write some in line comments
--> (important: should not be about 'what' is happening, rather 'why' it is happening)

go through all methods and properties and check their access keywords (private, protected, default)
go through all methods and check if they need synchronisation

idk maybe commands as enums or stuff (later ig)
~ command for the client when s/he is in queue to choose whether s/he wants to play with AI when there are no other players in q
