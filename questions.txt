1. What's wrong with the moveLine test (individual vs. all)  // the boards and array are the same (maybe array is being changed somewhere)
2. How do we test private (public) methods and should we // like for example in player for checking if the ball has been added
3. Can we use lambda functions (even though we took them right of the internet :D )
